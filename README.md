# Domain Adaptation with Adversarial Training and Graph Embeddings

## Introduction

This is forked form the implementation of [Planetoid](https://github.com/kimiyoung/planetoid), a graph-based semi-supervised learning method proposed in the following paper:
[Revisiting Semi-Supervised Learning with Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08861).
Zhilin Yang, William W. Cohen, Ruslan Salakhutdinov., ICML 2016.

For the implementation with Domain Adaptation with Adversarial training, we significantly modified the code. Below, we provide the details.

We will make the code publicly available soon. Please be patient.

## Prerequisites
- python 2.7
- gensim
- lasagne
- keras with tensorflow backend
- Please download Word2Vec model.
